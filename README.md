# This is a third-party tool that uses GLS’s public REST API to show parcel status. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by GLS Group.

# Privacy Policy for Parcel Status Watcher (GLS-compatible)

This browser extension is developed by an independent developer and is not affiliated with or endorsed by GLS Group.

## Data Collection
The extension does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information.  
All parcel tracking data (tracking numbers, postal codes, and status updates) are stored locally in your browser using Chrome’s built-in storage API.

## Network Requests
The extension makes direct requests to the official GLS Group API (https://gls-group.eu) to retrieve public tracking information for the tracking numbers you enter.  
No data is sent to any other server.

## Third-Party Services
No analytics, advertising, or external data collection services are used.

## Permissions
The extension requests minimal permissions:
- `storage` — to save your tracking list locally  
- `notifications` — to show desktop alerts when a parcel’s status changes  
- `alarms` — to periodically check for updates  
- `host_permissions` — limited to https://gls-group.eu/* to fetch tracking data
